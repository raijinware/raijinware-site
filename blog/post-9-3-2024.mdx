This is the first blog post that I'm making on *my* website! 

I decided to make this website because I've been doing web development for a while,
and I really wanted to make something for my own that other people will be able to access.
*OR* I can access anywhere that I want. 

I made this with gatsby because I know that it'll be relatively easy to plug API's 
into the code, and it'll give me some extra practice with react. 

I have a lot of plans for this website. Here are some of my ideas for additions:
* Calculators that I can use to make conversions.
* A weather site with the national weather service api.
* Some small javascript games, such as sudoku.
* A portfolio for my website designs.
* Recipes that I create and alter when I make food.
* This blog! I want to talk about my adventures with computer science. Everything from web design to creating apps to building things with arduino/raspberry pi projects!


Thank you for reading!
